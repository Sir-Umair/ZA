        Physical and Chemical Properties
        Physical Properties
        Appearance: Colorless to slightly yellow viscous liquid.
        Density: ~1.84 g/cm³.
        Boiling Point: 337°C (639°F).
        Melting Point: 10°C (50°F).
        Solubility: Miscible with water, releasing significant heat during dissolution.
        Chemical Properties
        Strong Acid: Fully dissociates in water to produce H⁺ ions.
        Dehydrating Agent: Removes water from substances (e.g., turning sugar into carbon).
        Oxidizing Agent: Can oxidize metals and nonmetals under certain conditions.

    </h1>
    <h2>
        Hydrochloric acid is a solution of hydrogen chloride (HCl) gas dissolved in water. It is a colorless, highly acidic liquid with a pungent odor. In its gaseous form, it’s known as hydrogen chloride, which is toxic and irritating.

Chemical Formula:
HCl

Properties of Hydrochloric Acid
Physical Properties:
Appearance: Colorless to pale yellow liquid.
Density: 1.18 g/cm³ (for concentrated HCl).
Boiling Point: 110°C.
Melting Point: -27°C.
Chemical Properties:
Strong Acid: HCl dissociates completely in water to release hydrogen ions (H⁺), making it highly acidic.
Corrosive: It can burn through metals and tissues, causing severe damage on contact.
Reactivity: Reacts with metals like zinc and iron, releasing hydrogen gas.
Production of Hydrochloric Acid
Hydrochloric acid is produced mainly by two methods:
